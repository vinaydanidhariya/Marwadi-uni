Abstract Class

5. create abstract class Vehicle that have abstract method engine().
create car class that extends vehicle that override method of vehicle
and give message as "car engine‚Äù. Create main class call car engine
method.

6. Create Instrument abstract class that have data member name as
String and abstract method play(). create abstract class
StringInstrument that extends Instrument that have data member
numberofStrings as int. create ElectricGuitar that extends
StringInstrument in constructor assign name="Guitar" and
NumberofStrings=6 manually override play method that print
numberofString and name. Now create main class create object of
ElectricGuitar, and take appropriate output by calling methods.

7. Create abstract class person that have two data member name and
gender as String. That have parameterized constructor in which two
parameter is there one for name other for gender assign that value to
class instance variable. It also has abstract method work and also has
display method that will print name and gender. Create another class
Employee that extends Person that have one data member empId as
integer in that constructor it have 3 parameters name, gender and
empId now assign name and gender two super class instance variable
using super keyword and id to current class instance variable. it
override work method in which check if empId is equals to 0 then give
message that employee is not working else Working as Employee.
Create main class create object of Employee provide name, gender and
employee id as 0. Now create other object provide name, gender and
employee id as any id and call work method from both objects. Now
call display method and see the output.


interface

8. Create interface named Printable that have print() method as no
return type. create another interface named Showable that have
show() method as no return type. Create class called InterfaceEx that
implements both interface. Override Method print() and give message
"Hello". also override method show() and give message "Welcome".
now create main class create object of InterfaceEx class and call both
method.

9. Write a Java Program to define an interface with one constant value
discount and three methods getData(), process() and putData().
Implement this interface in a class. User should enter product name &
price display total amount after discount.(Discount : 10%)
10. Write a program to create interface A in this interface we have two
method meth1 and meth2. now create another interface called B that
extends A that have meth3() Implements this interface in another class
named MyClass. override all method with appropriate message. create
main class IFExtend create object of MyClass and call all methods.

11. Create a class Number that have x and y data member as int. create
interface Arithmetic that have add and sub method with two integer
arguments and int as return data type. Now create class UserInterface
that extends Number class and implements Arithmetic interface
override methods return addition in add and subtraction in sub
method. in main method create obj of UserInterface and pass two
integer arguments while calling methods.
